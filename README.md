# Plutio Developer Skill Test

This test is comprised of 3 parts based on a basic Meteor app. All 3 parts of the test must be completed specifically as instructed without anything additional. 

Feel free to use any npm modules. Start the app by running `npm start`. When you are done, zip all files except `.meteor` and `node_modules` and send to `leo@plutio.com`.

Good luck.


## Part 1

Refactor `imports/ui/app.js`. Split the file into smaller modules, as many as you feel like. You can create any amount of directories and files you need.

The logic of task indicators is as follows:

- `icon-description` is visible if `hasDescription` is `true`
- `icon-chat` is visible if `commentsCount` is more than `0`
- `icon-attach` is visible if `filesCount` is more than `0`
- `icon-timer` is visible if `icon-timer` is more than `0`

## Part 2

In `imports/api/tasks/methods` you will see 2 empty files `get.js` and `create.js`. You need to create 2 simple methods:

- `get.js` - Get all tasks that does not have `isPrivate` set to `true`.
- `create.js` - Create a new task method. It should only allow setting fields `title`, `dueDate`, `repeat`, `status`, `customFields` and `color`.

Use created `get` method to load tasks and show it in UI.
Use created `create` method to insert a new task when `Enter` button is clicked on `Add new task` form.

## Part 3

Write a test of `create` and `get` methods inside `tests` folder. You can run tests with `npm run test`.


## Task Implemented

- Split `imports/ui/app.js` file into smaller modules and implemented logics for task indicators.
- Created `get` and `create` methods for list and add task.
